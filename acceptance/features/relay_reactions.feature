Feature: mirroring reactions
  Every copy of a relayed message shows the reactions on the others. On Discord the bot adds each
  emoji as its own reaction; on Telegram a bot can only react once, so it shows the most used one.

  Background:
    Given a chat with id 8701
    And a user with id 8711 and first name "Tester"
    And a Discord server "8701" named "React One" with channel "87011" named "general"
    And a Discord server "8702" named "React Two" with channel "87021" named "cs"
    And a Discord server "8703" named "React Plain" with channel "87031" named "general" where the bot lacks "Manage Webhooks"
    And Discord channel "87011" is linked to the chat
    And Discord channel "87021" is linked to the chat
    And Discord channel "87031" is linked to the chat

  Scenario: a Telegram reaction shows on every Discord copy
    When the user sends "ace!"
    Then Discord channel "87011" receives "ace!" from "Tester"
    When user 8712 reacts to that message with "👍"
    Then Discord channel "87011" sees the bot react with "👍" to "ace!"
    And Discord channel "87021" sees the bot react with "👍" to "ace!"
    And Discord channel "87031" sees the bot react with "👍" to "ace!"
    And the bot does not react on Telegram
